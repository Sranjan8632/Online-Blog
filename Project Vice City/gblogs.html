          Earlier this year, Rockstar Games confirmed that the next Grand Theft
          Auto title was in development, confirming a number of leaks and
          speculations around the awaited title. However, details around GTA 6
          remained scarce, meaning fans of the series who have been waiting for
          the next GTA game since 2013’s GTA V would have to continue to wait
          indefinitely before they knew anything about the new title. That
          changed earlier this month, when leaked assets from GTA 6 spread like
          wildfire through the internet. The leaks included several in-game
          clips and code that revealed a lot about the game, including parts of
          the map, gameplay elements and NPC (Non-player character) mechanisms.
          The leaks also confirmed a number of other leaks already out there,
          including the presence of a female protagonist, a first in Rockstar
          Games’ history. Here’s everything we now know about GTA 6.

          <h3>What About Call Of Duty : Mordern Warfare II</h3>

          <p class="para">Modern Warfare 2 will be available from 28 October 2022. It's being developed mainly by Infinity Ward, but there are apparently 10 more studios working in support capacities on the game, although this sort of resource-sharing is nothing new for the series.

If you pre-order the game digitally, you'll be able to play the campaign from 20 October 2022, a week early, which is a welcome bonus.After a lot of slow hype-building, the wraps are now completely off Modern Warfare 2, with plenty of trailers out there and a series of betas to participate in if you want to try it out.You can watch the reveal trailer above to get a first look at the game's campaign, spanning a few locations and looking like an explosive ride. The launch trailer is also at the top of this page, showing even more.Call of Duty normally comes out on every single platform that can run it, to maximise sales, but everything changed in January 2021 when Xbox announced that it was buying Activision, the series' publisher.

The news sent shockwaves through the community since it threatened the possibility that Call of Duty might become an exclusive series to Xbox hardware on console somewhere down the line. While that's possible eventually, it doesn't affect Modern Warfare 2.

The game will release before the deal is completed, and existing contracts with PlayStation means that at least the next main COD to come out in 2023 should also appear on PS4 and PS5. Microsoft has also stated that it intends to keep the franchise on PlayStation once those deals run out.

For now, we know that Modern Warfare 2 is coming out on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC - including a return to Steam for the first time in years.Allegedly codenamed internally as Project Cortez, the game will feature a single-player campaign that's rumoured to take place during the American-led War on Drugs in South America, something that the first trailer hasn't really confirmed or dispelled. 

According to further reporting by Tom Henderson, the game will be even grittier than Modern Warfare 2019, which already leant further into realism than Call of Duty has for a while, with missions like Clean House featuring realistic room clearances and night vision.

           <h3>Don't Forget I.G.I ORIGINS  </h3>
           <iframe class="vid"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SHaDwa1J0k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
           <p class="para">Publisher Toadman Interactive announced, back in 2019, that a new IGI game was in development, led by Rising Storm 2: Vietnam developer Antimatter Games. IGI Origins remained shrouded in mystery for a lengthy period of time but, as we head into the second half of 2021, more details about its release date are slowly starting to emerge.

IGI Origins' announcement was accompanied by a short glimpse at its prototyping stage. Back then, its release date was slated for some time in 2021, but fans eager to see how it lives up to Innerloop Studios' first two entries in the tactical shooter series will have to wait a bit longer.Earlier in July 2021, Game Director Rich Barnham said in a video update that development was "going exceptionally well." At the same time, IGI Origins' release date was moved to some point in 2022, while the publisher and developer have yet to commit to a fixed date.

IGI Origins is a prequel to 2000's Project IGI and puts players in the role of Michael King an ex-SAS soldier undertaking covert, global missions for MI6 "to target an enemy with a world war in their sights."

"Armed with a sophisticated arsenal to divert, outsmart or wipe-out your adversaries, decide your approach; ghost-like espionage or heavy firefights. Twisted actions raise questions over the true enemy and harden your resolve against a shifting, hostile world," reads its Steam description.

The title is developed using Unreal Engine 4 and will be a single-player experience, a post from August 2021 reveals. It also contains the results of a fan survey that the developer is taking into account as it builds the next entry.

No gameplay was shown initially, but that changed in September 2022, when we got our first glimpse of the game in action, showcasing some of the arsenal available to us when IGI: Origins' release date comes around. We'll update this article as soon as we learn more about the game.
